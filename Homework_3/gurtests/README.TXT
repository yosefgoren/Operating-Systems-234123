put all files in test folder
change output.c time to 0.2
do chmod +X setup_server
run setup_server
do chmod +X run_test
run run_test


i changed the test and removed the part that test average time (the test didnt worked for me and i dont have thew time to fix it)
and change things base on my understanding of the piazza so double check the result
